FizzBuzz Custom Rules Engine

In general FizzBuzz implementation is straight forward with mulitple boolean checks. The real complexity araises, when we want to have
customized solution. This solution was developed for such use cases, with its own rule engine built for creating this kind of logic.

This is very basic rule engine which only allows one instance of particular type of rule. In case you want to run the with modified scope
please update corresponding specs.

No Nuget package Pubhlised. 

Will update the Rule engine going forward for making it more mature.
